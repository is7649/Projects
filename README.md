# Projects
# For this project I collected data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Data from a total of 404 colleges/universities was analyzed
Specific variables selected to for the query were as follows: state abbreviations, percent of students admitted, graduation rate total cohort, graduation rate for men,
graduation rate for women, core revenues, student to faculty ratio, in-state tuition and fees, out-of-state tuition and fees, 
percent of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded pell grants, full-time first-time undergraduates awarded any financial aid, ACT Composite 75th Percentile Score,
SAT Evidence Based Reading and Writing 75th Percentile Score, SAT Math 75th Percentile Score, total men, total women, and retention rate. A csv file was created using
the variables and colleges. This csv file was then uploaded to R, where the different variables were analyzed in respect to the corresponding graduation rate. 
This was done by first forming a scatter plot of graduation rate vs. variable. Each scatterplot was carefully analyzed by observing association 
and checking for the following conditions: quantitative variable, outlier, homoscedasticity, and linearity. Independence was assumed.
